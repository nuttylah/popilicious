      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Popilicious is a thriving snack business owned by SR Nur Aleya Farisha, a dedicated student from Mahallah Halimatus Saadiah, operating within the IIUM Gombak campus. Specializing in delicious and affordable popia-based treats, Popilicious has become a popular name among students and event-goers for over a year now. Although the business does not have a permanent stall, it remains highly active by participating in various events and festivals around campus, such as ICC events, KAED Fest, and other student-organized programs. This mobile business model allows Popilicious to reach a wider audience and maintain flexibility, making it a go-to snack option whenever there's a happening on campus. Nur Aleya Farisha’s entrepreneurial spirit and consistency in delivering quality snacks have helped establish Popilicious as a beloved brand among the IIUM student community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popilicious is a small-scale food business inspired by Islamic values and initiated by SR Nur Aleya Farisha from Mahallah Halimatus Saadiah, International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). At its core, Popilicious is not merely a commercial venture but represents a conscious effort to engage in ethical, halal entrepreneurship. Islam encourages the pursuit of lawful sustenance, as stated in the Qur’an: “Eat of what is lawful and good that Allah has provided for you, and be grateful for the favor of Allah, if it is [indeed] Him that you worship” (Surah An-Nahl, 16:114). By using halal ingredients and maintaining cleanliness, quality, and integrity in the preparation and sale of its signature snack which banana wrapped in popiah skin and fried to perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the initiative is built upon the Islamic values of amanah (trustworthiness), ihsan (excellence in service), and barakah (divine blessing). The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: “The truthful and trustworthy merchant will be with the Prophets, the truthful, and the martyrs” (Tirmidhi, Hadith 1209). Popilicious aims to conduct its operations with sincerity and professionalism, recognizing that ethical business is an extension of faith. In addition to economic benefit, this initiative promotes ta’awun—mutual assistance within the community—as encouraged in the Qur’an: “And cooperate in righteousness and piety…” (Surah Al-Ma’idah, 5:2). By supporting Popilicious, members of the IIUM community are directly contributing to the empowerment of young entrepreneurs and encouraging sustainable, values-based development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, Popilicious aspires to be more than a food outlet. It seeks to uphold a model of Islamic entrepreneurship that aligns with the university’s mission of integrating knowledge and faith. With sincere intention (niat), business itself can become a form of worship and a means of ongoing reward (sadaqah jariyah) when it contributes to personal growth, community welfare, and the betterment of society. Popilicious stands as a testament to how simple initiatives, when guided by Islamic principles, can become impactful and meaningful.
